The following plot illustrates the proportion of exposures that would be above
the OEL in a fictional sample of one hundred measurements. Each flask
represents an exposure. Red flasks correspond to exposures that are above the
exposure limit. The plot can be shown in one of four variations. You may choose
any variant (an alternative way of displaying the same information) below and,
optionally, customize colors.

Risk assessment based on the arithmetic mean relies on the availability of a
long-term averaged OEL (LTA-OEL in the AIHA terminology) representing a
cumulative burden threshold. Most current OELs are not created as LTA-OEL.

Despite an annoying lack of precise definition by most organizations, they
should be most often viewed as thresholds to be exceeded as few times as
possible. Some authors have suggested using one-tenth of the OEL as a practical
LTA-OEL when assessing risk using the arithmetic mean.

takes into account estimation uncertainty with stripped symbols. The number of
