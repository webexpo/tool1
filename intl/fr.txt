Risk assessment based on the arithmetic mean relies on the availability of a
long-term averaged OEL (LTA-OEL in the AIHA terminology) representing a
cumulative burden threshold. Most current OELs are not created as LTA-OEL.

Despite an annoying lack of precise definition by most organizations, they
should be most often viewed as thresholds to be exceeded as rarely as possible.
Some authors have suggested using one-tenth of the OEL as a practical LTA-OEL
when assessing risk using the arithmetic mean.

The parameters shown here are a simple description of the measurements. They
ensure that the data input and import process went well and that there are no
obvious outliers. They should not be viewed as useful estimates of the
underlying exposure distribution. For that purpose, use the other panels
(Exceedance Fraction, Percentiles, or Arithmetic Mean above) where inference is
based on Bayesian models.

The plot on the left shows an acceptable situation for the chosen exceedance
threshold (traditionally 5% above the OEL). The plot on the right shows the
situation estimated by the Bayesian model. It takes into account estimation
uncertainty with stripped symbols. The number of plain symbols represents the
best estimate of the number of measurements above the OEL. The total number of
symbols (either plain or stripped) represents the maximum plausible number of
measurements above the OEL given estimation uncertainty (using the upper limit
of the underlying credible interval).

acceptable exceedance. Red symbols outside of it are unacceptable exposures. It
does not take into account estimation uncertainty.
