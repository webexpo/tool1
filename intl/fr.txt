This plot shows the probability distribution of the uncertainty around the
arithmetic mean. It shows the probability that its true value is (1) below 1%
of the OEL, (2) between 1% and 10% of the OEL, (3) between 10% and 50% of the
OEL, (4) between 50% and 100% of the OEL, and (5) greater than the OEL. This is
based on the classification adopted by AIHA. The red column represents the
probability of an overexposure. The latter should be lower than the threshold
(black dashed line).

Risk assessment based on the arithmetic mean relies on the availability of a
long-term averaged OEL (LTA-OEL in the AIHA terminology) representing a
cumulative burden threshold. Most current OELs are not created as LTA-OEL.

Despite an annoying lack of precise definition by most organizations, they
should be most often viewed as thresholds to be exceeded as rarely as possible.
Some authors have suggested using one-tenth of the OEL as a practical LTA-OEL
when assessing risk using the arithmetic mean.

:: Translations: 426cfe3: Translation

L'évaluation des risques basée sur la moyenne arithmétique repose sur la
disponibilité d'une VLE moyenne à long terme (OEL-LTA dans la terminologie de
l'AIHA) représentant un seuil de charge cumulative. La plupart des VLE actuelles
ne sont pas des VLE moyennes à long terme.

En dépit d'un manque gênant de définition précise de la part de la plupart des
organisations, les VLE devraient être le plus souvent considérées comme des
seuils à dépasser aussi rarement que possible. Certains auteurs ont suggéré
d'utiliser un dixième de la VLE comme VLE moyenne à long terme  lors de
l'évaluation des risques à l'aide de la moyenne arithmétique.

This plot shows the estimated exposure distribution when assuming 250 exposure
measurements have been collected. If the measurements represent 8-hour TWA
(Time-Weighted Average) values, this approximately represents a full year of
exposure. The OEL is shown as a red dotted line and the point estimate of the
arithmetic mean as a continuous green line.

uncertainty with stripped symbols. The number of plain symbols represents the

symbols (either plain or stripped) represents the maximum plausible number of
measurements above the OEL given estimation uncertainty (using the upper limit

1% of the OEL, (2) between 1% and 10% of the OEL, (3) between 10% and 50% of

Select a threshold for the probability that this criterion is met, above which
remedial action (or additional sampling) should be required. Equivalently, one
can reason in terms of the degree of confidence that the exposure criterion is
not met: an overexposure risk threshold of at most 30% is equivalent to
reaching at least 70% confidence that there is no overexposure.

The traditional threshold for the probability of overexposure is 5% (i.e.
reaching 95% confidence that there is no overexposure). More recently,
following foundational work in France around 2010, several institutions have
adopted an overexposure risk threshold of 30% (70% level of confidence).
Discussion about the rationale for the use of 70% confidence (or a 30%
tolerable overexposure risk) can be found in the following scientific paper.
