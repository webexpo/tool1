This plot shows the probability distribution of the uncertainty around the
arithmetic mean. It shows the probability that its true value is (1) below 1%%
of the OEL, (2) between 1%% and 10%% of the OEL, (3) between 10%% and 50%% of
the OEL, (4) between 50%% and 100%% of the OEL, and (5) greater than the OEL.
This is based on the classification adopted by %s. The red column represents

This plot illustrates the proportion of exposures that would be above the OEL
in a fictional sample of one hundred measurements. Each flask represents an
exposure value. Those that are above the exposure limit are colored in red.
This can be changed according to your needs using the sidebar on the right.
Four variants of the Exceedance Plot are available.

Risk assessment based on the arithmetic mean relies on the availability of a
long-term averaged OEL (LTA-OEL in the AIHA terminology) representing a
cumulative burden threshold. Most current OELs are not created as LTA-OEL.

Despite an annoying lack of precise definition by most organizations, they
should be most often viewed as thresholds to be exceeded as rarely as possible.
Some authors have suggested using one-tenth of the OEL as a practical LTA-OEL
when assessing risk using the arithmetic mean.

Tool 1 assumes that the measurements represent a random sample drawn from the
underlying distribution of exposures within the sampled context. In other

being assessed.
