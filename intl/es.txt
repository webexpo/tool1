Risk assessment based on the arithmetic mean relies on the availability of a
long-term averaged OEL (LTA-OEL in the AIHA terminology) representing a
cumulative burden threshold. Most current OELs are not created as LTA-OEL.

Despite an annoying lack of precise definition by most organizations, they
should be most often viewed as thresholds to be exceeded as rarely as possible.
Some authors have suggested using one-tenth of the OEL as a practical LTA-OEL
when assessing risk using the arithmetic mean.

The decision scheme adopted for the Express mode of Tool 1 was elaborated
during the creation of the AIHA video series %s (English only). In that scheme,
reaching 95%% is ideal and yields an acceptable situation. Not reaching 95%%
confidence but reaching 70%% confidence makes the situation tolerable. Not
reaching 70%% confidence that there is no overexposure makes the situation

The plot on the left shows an acceptable situation for the chosen exceedance
threshold (traditionally 5% above the OEL). The plot on the right shows the
situation estimated by the Bayesian model. It further illustrates the
uncertainty of the estimation with stripped flasks. The number of red plain
flasks represents the best estimate of the number of measurements above the
OEL. The total number of red flasks (either plain or stripped) represents the
maximum plausible number of measurements above the OEL given the uncertainty of
the estimation process (using the upper limit of the underlying credible
interval).

Select a threshold for the probability that this criterion is met, above which
remedial action (or additional sampling) should be required. Equivalently, one
can reason in terms of the degree of confidence that the exposure criterion is
not met: an overexposure risk threshold of at most 30% is equivalent to
reaching at least 70% confidence that there is no overexposure.

The traditional threshold for the probability of overexposure is 5% (i.e.
reaching 95% confidence that there is no overexposure). More recently,
following foundational work in France around 2010, several institutions have
adopted an overexposure risk threshold of 30% (70% level of confidence).
Discussion about the rationale for the use of 70% confidence (or a 30%
tolerable overexposure risk) can be found in the following scientific paper.
